# 🛤️ Shortest Path Finder

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Shortest Path Finder** is a dynamic pathfinding visualizer built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It offers a real-time demonstration of popular pathfinding algorithms, making it a great tool for understanding how these algorithms work.

## 🌟 Features
- **🛤️ Pathfinding Visualization**: Watch as the algorithms find the shortest path from a starting point to a destination.
- **🧮 Algorithms Implemented**:
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Weighted) ⚖️: Guarantees the shortest path by exploring the least costly path first.
  - **Breadth-First Search** (Unweighted) 🌐: Ensures the shortest path in an unweighted grid by exploring all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **💻 Interactive Interface**: Users can set start and end points, add obstacles, and visualize the pathfinding process in real-time.

## 📚 Project Structure
- **HTML**: The structure of the visualizer.
- **CSS**: Styling for the grid and control elements.
- **JavaScript**: Implementation of the pathfinding algorithms and user interactions.

## 🛠️ How to Run
